            <p> - Bees play a massive role in pollinating the plants that we eat. A single bee colony can pollinate 300 million flowers in a day. Approximately 75% of the worldâ€™s crops depend on pollinators.[11] In North America, bees help with the production of at least 90 crops</p>
            <p> - Since 1900, the UK has lost 13 species of bee, and a further 35 are considered under threat of extinction. None are protected by law. Across Europe nearly 1 in 10 wild bee species face extinction.</p>
